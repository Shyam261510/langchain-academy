      "\n",
      "*   **A. The Evolving Landscape of Software Development:**\n",
      "    *   Emergence of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) as foundational technologies.\n",
      "    *   Demand for engineers proficient in building intelligent, agentic systems.\n",
      "*   **B. Why MERN Developers are Uniquely Positioned:**\n",
      "    *   Strong foundation in web application architecture, API development, data handling, and UI/UX.\n",
      "    *   Existing proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB directly transferable to AI application development.\n",
      "*   **C. Core Focus: LLM Orchestration with LangChain & LangGraph:**\n",
      "    *   Understanding the need for frameworks to manage complex LLM interactions, tool use, and stateful reasoning.\n",
      "    *   LangChain for modularity, prompt engineering, RAG, and basic agents.\n",
      "    *   LangGraph for stateful, cyclical, and multi-agent workflows.\n",
